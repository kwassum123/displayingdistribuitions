    <h1>Visualizing Distributions</h1>
      <h2>Distribution</h2>
        <p>Distribution is the term Cairo uses to refer to all of the values of a data set together; usually within the context of 
          something visual or graphical. A distribution is visualized with a graph. He also describes what a normal distribution 
          is and its properities. These properties being:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Its mean, median, and mode are the same.</li>
            <li>The distribution is symmetrical: 50% of scores are above the mean, and 50% of scores are below it.</li>
            <li>We know what percentage of scores lay in between certain ranges: 68.2% of cases in the data are 1 standard 
              deviation (sd)
              away from the mean, 95.4% are within 2 sd, and 99.8% are within 3.</li>
            <li>We can do some arithmetic with those figures.</li>
          </ol>
      <h2>The Elements of Distribution</h2>
        <p>A distribution has 4 elements that can be used to visually describe it.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Level</dt>
            <dd>Within exploritory data analysis, the level of distribution is another term for the measures of central tendency, 
              as they
              give you an idea of the average size of your numbers and what their centre point is.
            <dt>Spread</dt>
            <dd>The spread of a distribution tells how wide the set of data is. More specifically it could indicate the range of 
              the data,
              the standard deviation, the variance, and the quartiles.</dd>
            <dt>Shape</dt>
            <dd>The shape of the graphical data indicates the dispresion/spread of the data, its variability, scatter, where the mean 
              lies,
              and possibly what the range of the data set is.</dd>
            <dt>Outliers</dt>
            <dd>An outlier is any datum that lies on the outside of 1.5 times the Interquartile Range (the difference between the first
              and third quartiles) either over Q3 or below Q1. Any outliers are possibly due to variability within the nature of 
              the data
              or may indicate experimental error.</dd>
